# This file contains common pin mappings for the BigTreeTech Octopus
# (non-Pro) boards.

# Important! Do not use this config with an Octopus Pro v1.1 board as
# doing so could result in a heater being inadvertently enabled.

# To use this config, start by identifying the micro-controller on the
# board - it may be an STM32F446, or STM32F429.  Select the
# appropriate micro-controller in "make menuconfig" and select "Enable
# low-level configuration options". For STM32F446 boards the firmware
# should be compiled with a "32KiB bootloader" and a "12MHz crystal"
# clock reference. For STM32F429 boards use a "32KiB bootloader" and
# an "8MHz crystal".

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

#   A list of G-Code commands to execute when an error is reported.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. The default is to

[pause_resume]
#recover_velocity: 50.
#   When capture/restore is enabled, the speed at which to return to
#   the captured position (in mm/s). Default is 50.0 mm/s.

##home_xy_position: 136.5, 125.75
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100, 100) where the Z homing should be
#   performed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 70.0
#   Speed at which the toolhead is moved to the safe Z home
#   coordinate. The default is 50 mm/s
#z_hop:20
#   Distance (in mm) to lift the Z axis prior to homing. This is
#   applied to any homing command, even if it doesn't home the Z axis.
#   If the Z axis is already homed and the current Z position is less
#   than z_hop, then this will lift the head to a height of z_hop. If
#   the Z axis is not already homed the head is lifted by z_hop.
#   The default is to not implement Z hop.
#z_hop_speed: 15.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) at which the Z axis is lifted prior to homing. The
#   default is 15 mm/s.
#move_to_previous: False
#   When set to True, the X and Y axes are reset to their previous
#   positions after Z axis homing. The default is False.

[exclude_object]

[shaketune]
result_folder: ~/printer_data/config/ShakeTune_results
#    Path where the processed results will be stored. If the folder doesn't exist,
#    it will be automatically created. You can change this if you'd like to store 
#    results in a different location.
number_of_results_to_keep: 10
#    This setting defines how many results you want to keep in the result folder.
#    Once the specified number is exceeded, older results will be automatically deleted
#    to free up space on the SD card and avoid cluttering the results folder.
keep_raw_data: False
#    If set to True, Shake&Tune will store both the processed graphs and the raw accelerometer
#    .stdata files in the results folder. This can be useful for debugging or archiving purposes.
#    Please always attach them when reporting any issues on GitHub or Discord.
show_macros_in_webui: True
#    Mainsail and Fluidd doesn't create buttons for system commands (macros that are not part
#    of the printer.cfg file). This option allow Shake&Tune to inject them into the webui at runtime.
#    If set to False, the macros will be hidden but still accessible from the console by typing
#    their names manually, which can be useful if you prefer to encapsulate them into your own macros.
timeout: 600
#    This defines the maximum processing time (in seconds) to allows to Shake&Tune for generating 
#    graphs from a .stdata file. 10 minutes should be more than enough in most cases, but if you have
#    slower hardware (e.g., older SD cards or low-performance devices), increase it to prevent timeouts.
measurements_chunk_size: 2
#    Each Shake&Tune command uses the accelerometer to take multiple measurements. By default,
#    Shake&Tune will write a chunk of data to disk every two measurements, and at the end of the
#    command will merge these chunks into the final .stdata file for processing. "2" is a very
#    conservative setting to avoid Klipper Timer Too Close errors on lower end devices with little
#    RAM, and should work for everyone. However, if you are using a powerful computer, you may
#    wish to increase this value to keep more measurements in memory (e.g., 15-20) before writing
#    the chunk and avoid stressing the filesystem too much.
max_freq: 200
#    This setting defines the maximum frequency at which the calculation of the power spectral density
#    is cutoff. The default value should be fine for most machines and accelerometer combinations and
#    avoid touching it unless you know what you're doing.
dpi: 300
#    Controls the resolution of the generated graphs. The default value of 300 dpi was optimized
#    and strikes a balance between performance and readability, ensuring that graphs are clear
#    without using too much RAM to generate them. Usually, you shouldn't need to change this value.
